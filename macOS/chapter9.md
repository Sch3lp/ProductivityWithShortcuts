To finish the tutorial series, we invite you to perform following tasks at your own leasure.
Feel free to start from any of the existing code packages, and go from there.

1. Create a new class that resides in a new package and has to interact with another existing class
2. Create a new test for that class
3. Create a new TestBuilder for the existing class
4. Perform a _red, green, refactor_
5. (Optional) commit and push
